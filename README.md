# LLM-Plus


LLM-Plus is an open source library meant to be used in conjunction with a LLM in order to enchance the functionality of the LLM.

# Principals

1. Let the LLM do the work: the model should be doing most if not all of the work. LLM-Plus is there simply to facilitate that.

2. Use small commits: Commits should do a single thing. This keeps the code clean and easy to iterate on.

3. Keep the responses clean: Final responses should be returned to the user unadultured.
